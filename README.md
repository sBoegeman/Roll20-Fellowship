# Roll20-Fellowship

A custom roll20 character sheet for playing Fellowship by Jakob Randolph.
This sheet is still under development. It currently supports most options used by members of the Fellowship and the three published Frameworks.

To-do:
  Add new options for the Fellowship playbook.
    Modify the Spells section to accomidate the Archmage destiny playbook
    Add support for The Pair and The Trio.
      This should include their individual names, which are incorporated into their roll macros.
    Review playbooks in Book 4 (Generiosity), and add what is currently not supported.
    Add an optional Fellowship Moves section, and convinient ways to track community Fellowships.
