# Roll20-Fellowship

A custom roll20 character sheet for playing Fellowship by Jakob Randolph.
This sheet is still under development. It currently supports most options used by members of the Fellowship and the Overlord Framework.

To-do:
  Add new options for the Fellowship playbook.
    Fix the Forbidden Element and Elemntal Master section for The Exile.
    Add new section for Words of Power.
    Add support for The Pair and The Trio.
      This should include their individual names, which are incorporated into their roll macros.
  Improve Overlord sheet.
    Revise the Generals section. New sections are needed, and it should be compatable with the Empire's Leaders. Should include the following:
      Name
      Stats
      Traits
      Background, notes, and other free-form text with no direct mechanical effects
    Update Overlord Bond section.
  Add Map as a fluid resource. 
  Add The Horizon Framework.
  Add The Location playbook used by The Horizon.
  Add The Empire Framework.
    This should use a structure similar to the revised General section on the Overlord Framework sheet.
